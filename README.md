# Student-analysis
Data is about the student performance in their final grade and to predict the overall passed and failed student.
# Outline of the assingment:
1) Extract the Data and Gather General Information of the Dataset
2) Visualize the three outputs ["G1", "G2" and "G3]
a) We will see how the data is distributed.
b) We will finally use "G3" as our output for our linear regression algorithm since it is the final and most important grade.
3) Split the data (Training and Testing sets.)
a) Implement StartiefiedShuffleSplit to the two most important features in terms of correlation with G3.
b) Create a binary column and a criteria determining what score is a Failing and what score is a Passing Grade.
4) Data Analysis and Visualization
a) Students that passed and failed the course (Using Plotly) (%).
6) Conclusion
